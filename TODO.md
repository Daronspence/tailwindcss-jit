# To Dos

#### The hazy period

- [x] Get our data structure rendering to CSS, perhaps rework data structure if needed
- [x] Solve for a candidate that has multiple rules with different order numbers
- [x] Make tabular nums work with media queries
- [x] Avoid redundant generation of rules used by multiple candidates
- [x] Avoid redundant generation of rules used by multiple candidates in variants
- [x] Generate a hover variant
- [x] Make a hover variant stack with a screen variant
- [x] Generate focus variant
- [x] Make a hover variant stack with a focus variant
- [x] Get a resolved config object we can use to read values from
- [x] Move variants and plugins to their own modules
- [x] Generate all screens based on config object
- [x] Make a dynamic plugin read from the config
- [x] Put utilities in right place (@tailwind utilities)
- [x] Add Preflight styles
- [x] ~~Figure out a more user-friendly API for specifying variant precedence~~ Just works baby.
- [x] Cache PostCSS nodes instead of our data structure? Lots of wasted time re-parsing styles we've already parsed
- [x] Cache all generated styles each build, only inserting generated styles for changed files and re-sorting/CSSifying then
- [x] Make sure variants are applied to all classes in a selector, not just first
- [x] ~~Enforce variants order (no hover:sm:underline)? Or just make it work~~ This just works, builds are faster if you use a consistent order though because it's a cache hit
- [x] Add tests for the love of god
- [x] Resolve config at run-time, re-resolve when config changes
- [x] Read template files from purge config, not from files config
- [x] Add support for `theme` function
- [x] Make animation utilities work
- [x] Make components/container generally work

#### Feb 25

- [x] Make the group-* features work
- [x] Add dark mode support
- [x] Put components, static utilities, and utilities into a single map for faster lookups
- [x] Sort responsive components before responsive utilities (need to reserve a bit for layer?)

#### Feb 26

- [x] Look for more specific matches, only run those matches (ring-offset shouldn't also run ring matches)
- [x] Refactor pass in modifier as string instead of parts array
- [x] Refactor plugins to use more specific keys
- [x] Support negative values, we don't see these utilities at all because of the `-` prefix, we also split on `-` so the prefix doesn't make it to the plugin
- [x] Avoid re-resolving config if build was triggered by template change
- [x] Use single addUtilities API for both static and dynamic plugins
- [x] Test with Vue components and <style> blocks (tons of watchers?)
- [x] Figure out how to support multiple PostCSS builds (this is extremely common, every Vue style block, every CSS module, etc. Need to be careful about global state)
- [x] Support multiple config formats but probably less than before
- [x] Figure out how to close Chokidar watchers whenever we generate a new context, I think we are leaking them
- [x] Flatten color palette once for performance

#### Feb 27

- [x] Simplify all of the concurrency code, model it more correctly
- [x] Avoid memory leak in contentMatchCache (every time a file is saved with different content this cache grows)
- [x] Figure out when to clear caches
- [x] Test with Laravel mix
- [x] Unify variants and screen variants

#### Feb 28

- [x] Basic @apply support

### Mar 1

- [x] Fix bug with focus:ring-2, we need to add the universal selector still not just strip it out, otherwise it's never added
- [x] Fix cache miss when fetching context for config
- [x] Make existing official plugins work
- [x] Add support for classic plugin API

### Mar 2

- [x] Support container configuration options
- [x] Support complex screens configuration
- [x] Support square brackets for arbitrary values

### Mar 3

- [x] Collapse media queries
- [x] Rebuild when config dependencies change

### Mar 4

- [x] Factor the code in a responsible way
- [x] Add support for custom CSS that supports variants (anything in @layer?)
- [x] Support "dynamic" components
- [x] Support "unconditional" rules â€” styles that should be included in the CSS no matter what
- [x] Unify components/utilities into single "rules" concept, remove tons of duplication

#### Next

- [ ] Make rule tuple format support comments and any other node types (@font-face) properly (considering abandoning this entire data structure in favor of PostCSS)
- [ ] Unify base styles into the same "rules" abstraction
- [ ] Make prefixes work
- [ ] Make important work
- [ ] Make separator work
- [ ] Support @apply with custom CSS
- [ ] Support purge safelist (just add entries to candidate list, regexes will be harder though)
- [ ] Only use `transformThemeValue` where necessary
- [ ] Support "dynamic" variants (like group-2, etc.)
- [ ] Refactor plugins to an abstraction that handles negative values, transformThemeValue, etc.
- [ ] Put plugins in deliberate order
- [ ] Include vendor prefixes for modern browsers by default so autoprefixer is only needed in production?
- [ ] Cache Preflight styles? They only change when the config changes (default font family, border color, etc.)
- [ ] Cache entire PostCSS tree and re-use if no candidate cache misses
- [ ] Move code to a feature flag in Tailwind, hopefully without introducing additional performance costs
